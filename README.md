# Streaming Content #

In this project you will work to solve a famous puzzle abut random selection. Here's
the puzzle:

You are given input stream through StdIn and two helper methods:

1. `String next()` which returns the next line of the stream and

2. `double random()` which returns a uniformly random number in the interval (0,1).

Your job is to write a method called `String randomLine()` which chooses, uniformly 
at random, a line from the input stream. That is, each line should have an equal 
prbability of being selected. Your code should run as quickly as possible and use as
litle memory as possible.

You can find starter code in this repository. Please submit your final work to
GitHub classroom. To submit, simply update the code for `RandomStream.java`.

This project will be worth **15 points** towards your final grade and is due by
**Monday September 6 at 8:00 am**.
